# Weather App

Created a weather forecasting website using the OpenWeather API. The OpenWeather API is an interface that allows users to access real-time weather data from the OpenWeather database, and I was able to integrate this information into my website to provide accurate and up-to-date weather forecasts for users.

I used a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build the website, which allows users to easily access the weather information they need.
